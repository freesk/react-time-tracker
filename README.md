# React Time Tracker  

This is a time tracking app powered by [React](https://reactjs.org), [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (with [Mongoose ODM](http://mongoosejs.com)).  

The app is still in development.

## Installation

## Development
The app stops tracking time if the current day gets changed.  
The client is missing server errors handling.
