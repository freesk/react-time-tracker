# React Time Tracker  

This is a time tracking app powered by [React](https://reactjs.org), [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (with [Mongoose ODM](http://mongoosejs.com)).  

The app is still in development.

## Installation
```
$ npm install
```
```
$ npm run postinstall
```
## Usage
```
$ npm start
```
## Development
The client is missing a signup form.  
The server is missing a json-to-csv conversion tool.
The server is missing email verification on a new signup request.  
The server is missing data validation.
Some refactoring is needed.   
This must be wrapped up as a [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) hybrid app.
